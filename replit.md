# Castle & Cannon Battle Game

## Overview

This is a full-stack web application for managing a classroom battle game where students earn army points in different categories (Castle, Cannon, Knight, Infantry, Archer) and can simulate battles. The application features a React frontend with TypeScript, an Express.js backend with PostgreSQL database using Drizzle ORM, and is deployed on Replit.

## System Architecture

The application follows a modern full-stack architecture with clear separation between client and server:

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui component library
- **State Management**: TanStack React Query for server state management
- **Routing**: Wouter for client-side routing
- **Build Tool**: Vite for development and production builds

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js server
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations
- **Database Provider**: Neon serverless PostgreSQL
- **Session Management**: PostgreSQL session store with connect-pg-simple
- **API Design**: RESTful API endpoints

### Project Structure
```
├── client/           # React frontend application
├── server/           # Express.js backend
├── shared/           # Shared TypeScript types and schemas
├── migrations/       # Database migration files
└── components.json   # shadcn/ui configuration
```

## Key Components

### Database Schema (shared/schema.ts)
- **users**: User authentication with username/password
- **students**: Student records with name and class
- **studentArmyPoints**: Army unit points for each student (castle, cannon, knight, infantry, archer)
- **battleResults**: Battle simulation results with power calculations and victory status

### API Endpoints (server/routes.ts)
- `GET /api/students` - Retrieve all students
- `GET /api/students/:id/army-points` - Get army points for specific student
- `POST /api/students/:id/army-points` - Update army points for student
- `POST /api/students/:id/battle` - Simulate battle for student
- `GET /api/leaderboard` - Get battle statistics leaderboard

### Storage Layer (server/storage.ts)
- **Interface-based design**: IStorage interface for database operations
- **Memory storage implementation**: MemStorage class for development/testing
- **Future PostgreSQL implementation**: Ready for production database integration

### Frontend Components
- **Home page**: Main game interface for student selection and point management
- **UI Components**: Complete shadcn/ui component library integration
- **Query management**: React Query for efficient data fetching and caching

## Data Flow

1. **Student Selection**: Users select a student from the list
2. **Point Management**: Add points to different army categories (castle, cannon, etc.)
3. **Battle Simulation**: Calculate total power and determine battle outcomes
4. **Leaderboard**: Display aggregated battle statistics across all students
5. **Real-time Updates**: React Query ensures UI stays synchronized with server state

## External Dependencies

### Frontend Dependencies
- **UI Library**: Radix UI components with shadcn/ui styling
- **State Management**: TanStack React Query for server state
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom design tokens
- **Forms**: React Hook Form with Zod validation

### Backend Dependencies
- **Database**: Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL driver
- **Validation**: Zod schemas for type-safe data validation
- **Session Storage**: connect-pg-simple for PostgreSQL session management
- **Development**: tsx for TypeScript execution, esbuild for production builds

## Deployment Strategy

### Development Environment
- **Command**: `npm run dev` starts both frontend and backend in development mode
- **Hot Reload**: Vite provides instant frontend updates
- **Database**: Uses Neon serverless PostgreSQL with DATABASE_URL environment variable

### Production Build
- **Frontend**: Vite builds optimized static assets to `dist/public`
- **Backend**: esbuild bundles server code to `dist/index.js`
- **Deployment**: Replit autoscale deployment with proper build and start commands

### Environment Configuration
- **Database URL**: Required DATABASE_URL environment variable for PostgreSQL connection
- **Port Configuration**: Server runs on port 5000, externally mapped to port 80
- **Static Assets**: Production server serves built frontend from `dist/public`
